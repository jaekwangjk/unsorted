Documentation of statisticsGBM
======================================================

The purpose of this page is to provide a user-manual for **statisticsGBM**, 
a code for for simulating the motion of grain boundaries using the threshold-dynamics. 
The original source files for are publisehd in the `statsticsGBM <https://github.com/tiagosalvador/statisticsGBM>`_, 
together with the paper "The Role of Surface Tension and Mobility Model in Simulations of Grain Growth (2019)", 
written by *Tiago Salvador and Selim Esedoglu*. 
  
in this document we will discuss an edited version for subsequent study on (xx).  
While Original source files are published in `here <https://github.com/tiagosalvador/statisticsGBM>`_ . 
is a library for simulating the motion of grain boundaries 
using the threshold-dynamics.
Refereced from (X) and the original code, 
it simulats the microstructure...

.. note::
   The code consists of ... both C+ and Matlab source files
